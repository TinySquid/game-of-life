# Conway's Game of Life

John Conway's "Game of Life" is a computer science classic from 1970. It's a program that simulates a cellular automaton, and has connections to all kinds of different aspects of computer science and nature.

## Rules of the Game

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
